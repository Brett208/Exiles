    DESCRIPTION     "Spaceports may now produce Nuclear Missiles. _______________________________________   Although dubbed 'nuclear missiles', our new superweapons are not actually the result of an uncontrolled fission reaction like the ones used on 20th century Earth.  These missiles are in fact employing a hot-fusion reaction, not unlike our Tokamak Fusion Reactors, with the important distinction that the reaction is designed to undergo a catastrophic containment failure just before impact.  It would be more accurate to describe these weapons as 'quick-and-dirty fusion missiles'.  The use of 'nuke' as a colloquialism is still hard to shake, however."
    TEASER          "Allows production of Nuclear Missiles at the Spaceport. _______________________________________   Our army is no match for the combined forces of Eden and Plymouth.  Even the most optimistic projections show we will fall before we can evacuate the planet... unless we can call upon one final trump card.  In one final act of desperation, the Council has authorized the development of an extremely powerful weapon to see us through this crisis."
