Commanders,

We've identified two "secret" research facilities, one belonging to Eden, the other to Plymouth, located in close
proximity to each other.  The Eden facility is home to ???, while the Plymouth outpost appears to be a dedicated starship research and launch facility.  We have
received word from a group of Plymouth engineers stationed at this facility that they wish to defect to our cause,
and have vital information on Plymouth's own space program that could help us.
