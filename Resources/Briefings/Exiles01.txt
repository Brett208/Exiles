Commanders,

Our worst fears have been realized.  Both Eden and Plymouth have degenerated into oppressive
police states.  We few, dissidents from each colony, have banded together so that even as
it struggles for survival, humanity will not succumb to its worst aspects.  We are the
Exiles, and we will fight for our freedom.

Before our hasty flight from our homes, we were only able to secure a few meager resources.
We have fled as far as these resources have allowed us and constructed a temporary base to
allow us to grow and prepare for the next leg of our journey.  Unfortunately, it seems that
the region we have settled in is seismically and volcanically active.  We thought New Terra
was geologically dead, but it seems our initial assessment may have been incorrect.  To
complicate matters, a Plymouth hunter-killer team has been spotted in the area; we believe
they are looking for us.  You will have to grow our fledgling base and prepare for our
relocation while fending off their attacks, and do so before the nearby volcano erupts and
destroys us all.

Our people are strong, and determined to survive, so morale is holding steady for now.
However, there are not many of us, and every death is strongly felt.  Constructing Medical
Centers will help keep our mortality rate low.

Although the tremors in this area are weak, they are still capable of damaging our
structures.  This, combined with the damage the Plymouth hunter-killer team will inevitably
cause, can be mitigated by constructing DIRTs.  DIRTs will reduce the damage inflicted on
our structures and also help with maintenance and repairs.

Act quickly, Commanders.  There is much to be done if our rebellion is to succeed.
