Commanders,

Four hours ago, we received a plea for help from a Plymouth agricultural outpost located dangerously close to The
Blight; computer projections show their position will be infected in 4 days.  The civilians' request for an evacuation
has been denied by Plymouth's leadership; it appears they suspect the colonists of being sympathetic to our cause,
and plan to use them as an example.  Plymouth has positioned patrols in the area, and has already destroyed several
Evacuation Transports carrying fleeing civilians.  They now ask us for help.

The Council has voted to rescue these people.  We have diverted the only forces we have operating in the
area - a small, lightly armed scouting convoy - to assist in the evacuation effort.  The outpost is, unfortunately,
located far from any of our own outposts, and a larger force would not arrive in time to rescue the civilians.

The colonists will begin constructing an evacuation convoy in secret.  Our forces will arrive under cover of
darkness, following an "accident" at the outpost's Tokamak, and escort the convoy to safety.  Because your forces
will be so heavily outnumbered, it is imperative that you do not reveal your presence to Plymouth's forces.  Keeping
your vehicles' lights off and staying outside of illuminated areas will be necessary if the evacuation
convoy is to survive.  Moving a single vehicle away from the convoy and turning on its lights could serve as a
distraction for the Plymouth patrols, but once Plymouth has identified a hostile vehicle, they will not cease their
pursuit of it.  Choose which vehicles you are willing to sacrifice carefully.

The timing of this operation is critical.  If the evacuation convoy has not escaped the patrols before the sun
rises, the convoy will be spotted and destroyed.

Act quickly, Commanders.  Innocent lives are at stake.
